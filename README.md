mondo is phat

 ... a relaxing game in which mondo eats his way to vengeance


BACKSTORY:

 mondo is a phat and phabulous cat.
 he owns it like a BOSS!
 he eats what he eats, he hates what he hates and
 does what he wants.

 all he wanted was to eat and sleep, but the haters wouldn't
 leave him alone.

 sometimes, there is a peace that can only be found after war.

 and today, mondo got out of the house.


GAME OBJECTIVE:
this is a relaxing game.  mondo eats the mice, chihuahuas,
and food.  he likes only tuna, strawberry jam, hot cocoa 
and scrambled egggs.

belly-bop the enemies (mice and chihuahuas)

jump to get the food.

watch your vengeance points accumulate.
