![Alt text](./images/mondo.png?raw=true "Mondi is Phat")


**BACKSTORY:**
 Mondo is a Phat and Phabulous cat.
 He owns it like a BOSS!
 He eats what he eats, he hates what he hates and
 does what he wants.

 All he wanted was to eat and sleep, but the haters wouldn't
 leave him alone.

 Sometimes, there is a peace that can only be found after war.

 And today, mondo got out of the house.


GAME OBJECTIVE:
This is a relaxing game.  Mondo eats the mice, chihuahuas,
and food.  He likes only tuna, strawberry jam, hot cocoa 
and scrambled egggs.

Belly-bop the enemies (mice and chihuahuas).

Jump to get the food.

Watch your vengeance points accumulate.

PROJECT ORIGIN:
This project was created under the challenge of learning a completely new-to-me framework (Phaser) with a time frame of 5-days, start to finish, start to launch.

UX:
The wireframes, user-persona and UX-report can be found at this repo:

TECHNICAL:
  - Mondo is Phat was built using Phaser, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, (with IntelXDK and Cordova to ship).

  - The setup code for window.onload resides in the js/main.js file, and from there the other game.state files are added.

  - All spritesheets are found in the "images" folder and were created with Sketch and GIMP.

  - Most of the physics were written using Phaser's built-in physics engine.

  - The mobile experience is slightly different than playing on the web, due to how the buttons were coded.  Users prefered not to have to push the "walk" buttons too often on mobile, but on the web clicking the walk buttons were found to be a little more satisfying.
